# abstract: "We present a method for the efficient processing of contact and collision in volumetric elastic models simulated using the Projective Dynamics paradigm. Our approach enables interactive simulation of tetrahedral meshes with more than half a million elements, provided that the model satisfies two fundamental properties: the region of the model's surface that is susceptible to collision events needs to be known in advance, and the simulation degrees of freedom associated with that surface region should be limited to a small fraction (e.g. 5%) of the total simulation nodes. In such scenarios, a partial Cholesky factorization can abstract away the behaviour of the collision-safe subset of the face model into the Schur Complement matrix with respect to the collision-prone region. We demonstrate how fast and accurate updates of bilateral penalty-based collision terms can be incorporated into this representation, and solved with high efficiency on the GPU. We also demonstrate iterating a partial update of the element rotations, akin to a selective application of the local step, specifically on the smaller collision-prone region without explicitly paying the cost associated with the rest of the simulation mesh. We demonstrate efficient and robust interactive simulation in detailed models from animation and medical applications."

We present a method for the efficient processing of contact and collision in volumetric elastic models simulated using the Projective Dynamics paradigm. Our approach enables interactive simulation of tetrahedral meshes with more than half a million elements, provided that the model satisfies two fundamental properties: the region of the model's surface that is susceptible to collision events needs to be known in advance, and the simulation degrees of freedom associated with that surface region should be limited to a small fraction (e.g. 5%) of the total simulation nodes. In such scenarios, a partial Cholesky factorization can abstract away the behaviour of the collision-safe subset of the face model into the Schur Complement matrix with respect to the collision-prone region. 

We demonstrate how fast and accurate updates of bilateral penalty-based collision terms can be incorporated into this representation, and solved with high efficiency on the GPU. We also demonstrate iterating a partial update of the element rotations, akin to a selective application of the local step, specifically on the smaller collision-prone region without explicitly paying the cost associated with the rest of the simulation mesh. We demonstrate efficient and robust interactive simulation in detailed models from animation and medical applications.
